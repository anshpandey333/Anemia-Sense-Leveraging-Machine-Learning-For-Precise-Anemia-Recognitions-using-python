## 🩺 Overview
Welcome to the Anemia Detection with Machine Learning project! This repository contains Python code for detecting anemia using machine learning algorithms. The dataset, provided by Biswa Ranjan Rao on Kaggle, can be found here.

The dataset includes:

1421 samples
6 attributes: Gender, Hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), and Result.
The Result attribute serves as the target variable, where:


## 🩸 Introduction to Anemia
Anemia is a condition marked by a deficiency in red blood cells or hemoglobin, crucial for oxygen transport in the body. Causes range from nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, genetic disorders, to significant blood loss.

Common Symptoms:
Fatigue 😴
Weakness 🥱
Shortness of breath 😮‍💨
Dizziness 😵‍💫
Pale skin 🧑‍⚕️
Irregular heartbeat 💓
Headaches 🤕
Treatment Approaches:
Dietary changes 🍎
Supplements 💊
Medications 💉
Blood transfusions 🩸 (in severe cases)
Prompt detection and treatment of anemia are crucial to prevent complications like heart issues, cognitive impairment, and developmental delays in children.
